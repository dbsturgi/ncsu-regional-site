# NC State ICPC Mid-Atlantic Regional Contest Site

## Equipment

For the contest, we will be using desktop computers in two labs.
Teams should not need to bring any of their own equipment for the
contest.  These labs normally seat 30 to 40 students.  We'll be using
putting each teem on a row of desks that normally seats three or four
students, so each team should have plenty of space.  There will be
other desktop machines, but only the center machine will be used for
the contest.

These computers will be running the standard contest image for our
site.  The main [mid-atlantic web
page](https://sites.radford.edu/~acm/midatl/) has some information
about languages and development tools available on this image.
